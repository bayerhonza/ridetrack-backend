# Properties file which configures the operation of the JDK logging facility.
#
# The configuration in this file is the suggesgted configuration
# for collecting trace for helping debug problems related to the
# Paho MQTT client.  It configures trace to be continuosly collected
# in memory with minimal impact on performance.
#
# When the push trigger (by default a Severe level message) or a
# specific request is made to "push" the in memory trace then it
# is "pushed" to the configured target handler. By default
# this is the standard java.util.logging.FileHandler. The Paho Debug
# class can be used to push the memory trace to its target
#
# To enable trace either:
# - use this properties file as is and set the logging facility up
#   to use it by configuring the util logging system property e.g.
#
# >java -Djava.util.logging.config.file=<location>\jsr47min.properties
#
# - This contents of this file can also be merged with another
#   java.util.logging config file to ensure provide wider logging
#   and trace including Paho trace
